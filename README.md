# Deep Learning Project (Image Classification) - Disease and Nutrient Deficiency Symptoms in Rice Plants
## Overview
Hi, my name is **Fadhil Reza Maulana**. Along with my teammate, [M. Naufal Aulia Adam](https://github.com/naadam13), we developed an application called PeSen (Petani Senang). This app utilizes image classification to predict diseases and nutrient deficiencies in rice plants.

* Fadhil Reza Maulana: Responsible for developing the disease prediction model.
* M. Naufal Aulia Adam: Responsible for developing the nutrient deficiency prediction model.
## Repository Contents
**This repository includes the following files and directories:**

* rice_disease_detection.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for modeling the image classification model for rice diseases.
* rice_nutrient_deficiency_detection.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for modeling the image classification model for rice nutrient deficiencies.
* output: Directory containing images of rice plants used for the rice disease model.
* PeSen (Petani Senang).pptx: PowerPoint presentation about our project and application.
**Deployment**
The project is deployed and can be accessed at [PeSen Deployment](https://paddysafe.streamlit.app/).
